A recommendation system is a type of information filtering system which predicts the rating or preference that a user would give to an item. A book recommendation system is a type of recommendation system where we have to recommend similar books to the reader based on their interest. Now a days online rating and reviews are playing important role in book sales. Readers only buy or read books depending upon the review and rating by others.

The web recommendation system have many challenges. When a user first joins the recommendation website, system does not know anything so it struggles suggesting books to the user. As many people join the platform and more books get added, the system takes long time to find suitable recommendations.  Users may worry about their privacy when it comes to sharing personal preferences. Some users may give fake ratings to certain books, making recommendation less accurate. And also the system promotes popular books neglecting other books. 

Solution
The system use a mix of collaborative filtering and popular recommendation to recommend books to the users according to the rating and user preferences. By using KNN(K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm the system speed up the process and recommends the books to the users. The system also filters the fake rating and helps in recommending the proper books to the user according to their similarities and interest. By regular checking and updating the algorithm the system provides the accurate books to the users.
